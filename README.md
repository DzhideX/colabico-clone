# Colabico-clone

Complex to-do list app with the ability to make a user profile and share your personal lists with anyone in the world. During the time I spent building this project, I used many different technologies on the way, and eventually also swapped some of them out to learn new ones.

## Technologies:

<h4> Frontend: </h4>

<ul>
  <li> React.js </li>
  <li> Redux </li>
  <li> connected-react-router </li>
  <li> Redux Saga </li>
  <li> SCSS </li>
</ul>

<h4> Backend: </h4>

<ul>
  <li> Express </li>
  <li> Firebase(swapped out for PostgreSQL and ouath2) </li>
  <li> PostgreSQL </li>
  <li> node-oauth2-server </li>
  <li> mocha+chai </li>
</ul>

As should be obvious by the name of the project, this project is a feature clone of: https://colabi.co/
